Whenever I would go to an art museum with my family, we would eventually wander into the 
modern art section of the gallery. My mother enjoyed the classical paintings, my father the 
furniture and architectural displays, my brother the abstract impressionisms, so none of them
were ever too keen on spending a lot of time in the modern art sections. I wouldn't say
I particularly enjoyed the modern art; I found it fascinating, but not necessarily enjoyable.

After we left the museum, one of us would say, without fail&mdash;usually my father&mdash;"I don't 
get why they display some of that stuff. It's just a red square they hung on the wall! Anyone can do that." 
And I agreed with that sentiment. There was nothing special, or difficult, or particularly talent-needing,
that it took to make this artwork. It was just a red square on the wall, for crying out load! Anyone could
do that. But, there it was, hanging on the wall of an art gallery. And someone would probably pay hundreds
of thousands of dollars for it&mdash;just a red square of canvas!
</p>

Naturally, I was horrified by this. What did 
</p>
<p>
You know, maybe the only purpose of the red square on the wall of the art gallery was to get people to think
about art, and what it really represents. I honestly think I took this whole matter in the wrong 
direction&mdash;thinking more about the artist than the actual art. But what's the difference, anyway?
