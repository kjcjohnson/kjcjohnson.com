<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>
This website has been with me for many years. I created the first 
incarnation over ten years ago, when I was first learning my way around
creating things with technology. This was the website in its purest 
form---just a collection of static html pages with css. It looked basically
identical to what it currently does, without some of the fancier features.
No JavaScript was used. This version of the site never made it onto the 
World Wide Web---it was more of an experiment than a serious venture.

The next version was a number of years later, when I made it into a web 
app. This was inspired by my desire to do something interesting with 
Common Lisp, and a web app seemed like the thing to do! This version, from
a client's perspective, looked exactly the same. The backend was the big
change---all of the web pages were being rendered on the fly! Still, this
version was never published---mostly because I had no server to publish it
to!
