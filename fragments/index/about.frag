I am interested in many things.

<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>
This is not a blog. Don't get confused that everything written here was
written for your sake---because it wasn't. This site is more like a look
into my personal study. I write this website because I want to write 
it---and not for any other reason. I enjoy putting my thoughts into words.
If you happen to get any enjoyment or use from what is on this website, 
I'm glad. I always appreciate my words being read and used. If you want to
leave a comment, you'll need to contact me directly---comment forms are 
the lowest of valleys of the Internet. It may even get added to a page if
I agree with it!
</p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>
This site is designed based on what I think the World Wide Web should be
like. You won't find any fancy page-scroll effects, massive JavaScript
files, or invasive advertisements here. What you get is a website that's
fast to load, information-dense, and secure. Feel free to have JavaScript
disabled on this website---it should not inhibit any important site 
behaviour whatsoever. (There are some JavaScript elements around, but they
do not contribute much.)
</p>

<p>
Notice, too, that this site is served over HTTPS only---this is by far the
most technology that is forced on the client. (And, my server is very 
restrictive on the TLS versions accepted.) While this site should be 
compatible with machines of many ages, all older machines will refuse a 
connection due to lack of TLS 1.2 support. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to eschew security altogether, I am currently developing a 
version of this site that is accessible from any (most) Telnet clients.
It is still in development, but it will be ready soon for clients of all
ages to connect to. Unfortunately, the Telnet version of this site will
be missing all of my music and images---but the literature will still be
available!
</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
This website has been with me for many years. I created the first 
incarnation over ten years ago, when I was first learning my way around
creating things with technology. This was the website in its purest 
form---just a collection of static html pages with css. It looked basically
identical to what it currently does, without some of the fancier features.
No JavaScript was used. This version of the site never made it onto the 
World Wide Web---it was more of an experiment than a serious venture.
</p>

<p>
The next version was a number of years later, when I made it into a web 
app. This was inspired by my desire to do something interesting with 
Common Lisp, and a web app seemed like the thing to do! This version, from
a client's perspective, looked exactly the same. The backend was the big
change---all of the web pages were being rendered on the fly! Still, this
version was never published---mostly because I had no server to publish it
to!
</p>

<p>
When I was in college, I got a little more adventurous. I began to make 
the pages more interactive and added some JavaScript elements (like the 
incredibly useful Login button---though it was broken for years!). At this
point, I actually managed to deploy it to "the cloud" (a fancy term for 
"someone else's computer"). At this point there were a lot of failed code
experiments, and my codebase got messy and very unmaintainable. Yet, the 
site still ran.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I began to go over the software again and clean it up. I 
refactored duplicates and cleaned and encapsulated functionality better. 
It runs a lot more smoothly now, and there's a bit of monitoring to help
me out! At this point, the content is being fleshed out significantly, 
though some of the earlier content (such as the "Blank Page") is being
kept for posterity's sake.
